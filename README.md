# Binary Search Tree

An implementation of a binary tree class with methods shown below.

## Features

- `insert()` - inserts a new node with the given value into the tree
- `remove()` - removes the node holding the given value from the tree
- `find(value)` - returns the node holding the given value in the tree
- `levelOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree in level order (breadth-first traversal)
- `inorder()` - traverses each node of the tree inorder (depth-first traversal)
- `preorder()` - traverses each node of the tree preorder (depth-first traversal)
- `postorder()` - traverses each node of the tree postorder (depth-first traversal)
- `height()` - returns the height of a node -- defined as the longest path between the given node and its furthest leaf node
- `depth()` - returns the depth of a node -- defined as the distance between the given node and the root node
- `isBalanced()` - returns true/false based on whether or not the tree is balanced
- `rebalance()` - rebalances the tree
- `prettyPrint` - prints the tree in the console in a human reader friendly format
